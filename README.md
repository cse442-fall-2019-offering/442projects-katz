**WebServer:** Yes

**Database:** Yes

**Expected Product:** Our project will consist of a website for peer review. This will be a rating system similar to rate my professor, with a target use for students. Students will be able to create accounts to rate people they have worked with in previous classes. They will also be able to discover other students in their corresponding classes to help them find a group, based on the skills required. Faculty will be able to generate and manage groups in their classes. This website will be based around HTML5/CSS and Javascript. It will require an intuitive front end as well as a backend that could deal with a network/database of people. This is why we are requiring a webserver and dataserver.

**User Base:** Our service will be similar to Rate My Professor and LinkedIn, with a main target use for students. Our service will allow users to register a profile and fill in basic information relating to their studies, such as university, major, expected graduation date, and also work experience such as internships or jobs relating to their field and the duties of that job. Once users have registered basic info, they can then fill in what classes they are taking and have taken in past semesters, with professor info. This will then allow other users to browse and look at other individuals in their own class. This will allow them to see past experience and knowledge such as programming languages and applications. Particular people that may have had recitation or projects with other students will then be able to leave comments and reviews of that student for future classmates to see and read. Then this will allow students in a course, when looking for a partner or people, can find people that will work for their specific idea. For example, it would be easy to find someone for a 442 project if you could only see those with iOS experience and a specific recitation time, or if you are trying to make a study group, view individuals that have C++ experience for your algorithms course.
