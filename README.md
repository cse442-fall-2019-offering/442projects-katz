Write 1 or 2 paragraphs describing the completed version of your project. (Developing estimates is very, very hard and takes years to do well. These descriptions are only to help your project manager understand your goals and prioritize the work to be done).
 
â‡’ Our project will consist of a website for peer review. This will be a rating system similar to rate my professor, but for students. Students will be able to create accounts to rate people they have worked with in previous classes. Students will also be able to discover other students in their corresponding classes to help them find a group based on the skills required. Faculty will also be able to generate and  manage groups in their classes. 
 
->The primary users of this website will consist of Campus faculty as well as undergrad students. Faculty will have an  easier time managing groups for their corresponding classes. Students will also be able to read and write reviews about one another which will help in future group forming. Students will also be able to see what students are available to join a group.
